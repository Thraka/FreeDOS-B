 TAIL v7.02aá          Filter out all but the "tail" (last few lines of text) 

         Free & Open DOS Utility by M.Aitchison@phys.canterbury.ac.nz

USAGE: TAIL [+|-lines] [filelist] [options]
  filelist: filename(s), separated by spaces, (e.g. *.BAK *abc*)

OPTiONS:
 /A:attr Attributes required            /C      Characters=n[k]               
 /F      Follow a growing file          /L      Lines=n                       
 /P[:x]  Pause[:pagesize]               /Q      Quiet                         
 /V      Verbose                       

ENViRONMENT VARiABLES:
 TAIL    Specify default options, e.g. SET TAIL=/Verbosity=16
 CLASS1=Error, CLASS2=Warn, _ANSI=NO, COMPATIBILITY=OpenDOS, LFN=NO

EXPLANATiON:
This command gives just the last few lines of the given text file
(or, if no files given, the standard input: You can use this as a
"pipe", e.g. DIR | FIND "95" | TAIL )

Using TAIL /F a file that is being updated by another job (if you are
using Taskmgr, for example) can be shown as it updates.


The command isn't "case sensitive"... I use capitals in the documentation
simply to highlight keywords.  You may enter the command and/or its options
using capital letters or lower case or any mixture.

You can use single-letter options or the full name, and if an option can
take parameters (e.g. /A:attr) you may use ":" or "=" to specify them (but
not a space).  For instance /A:RH and /Attribute=Rh and /atr:rH are all
equivalent.

You can set the CLASS1 and CLASS2 environment variables to override what the
program does when "fatal" and "non-fatal" conditions are encountered instead
of ending the programm or outputting a warning message to stderr respecively.
Setting CLASS1=W asks the program to continue with a warning message when an
error (such as a disk reading error) would normally have stopped the program.

You can use:
    Ignore - program continues without a warning message if possible
             (all the following will set the ERRORLEVEL > 0)
    Warning - a warning message is written to "stderr" (your screen);
              if the /L option has been used to list to the printer
              at most ONE warning message will also be written there.
    Error   - the program stops after writting an error message to "stderr"
    Abort   - the program stops without writing an error message
    Reboot  - the program halts the computer (if possible) after the message
