  BATT is a tiny program to display information about current power and
  battery status (remaining charge and operational time), which may be
  critical in mobile environments but not easily available when working under
  DOS, even that easily available through the Advanced Power Management BIOS
  interface. It is designed to run under plain DOS and may not work under
  MS Windows.
