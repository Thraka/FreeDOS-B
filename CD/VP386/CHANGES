Change log for VP386
====================

Initials in brackets indicate people who have brought problems to my
attention:

[SL] Santiago Lema
[DB] David Beswick
[EQ] "Equalizer," designer of Art of Code Paint (AOCP).
     Hmm, AOCP is gone.  Oh well.

Thank you to all who have helped me make this program better!

Release 1.4 beta 5 -> Release 1.4 FINAL (5.073), released 07/05/98
------------------------------------------------------------------
Wow!  I haven't worked on this for a year!

* FINAL release of VGAPaint 386.

* VPSTAT command removed; it was causing crashes with VETools.
  Maybe I'll fix it another time.

* Virus checks removed.

* Easter egg support pared; I don't think anyone cared, anyway.
  Boy, I removed a lot of stuff, didn't I?

* PMODE/W executable now included in main archive, not separately,
  as a stub program that "self-mutates" into the PMODE/W version.

* ASM source code upgraded to be MASM 6.13 compliant.


Release 1.4 beta 4 -> Release 1.4 beta 5
----------------------------------------
* 24/16-bit to 8-bit 'skewed' conversion error fixed in AVI read routines.

Release 1.4 beta 3 -> Release 1.4 beta 4 (5.061), released 07/29/97
-------------------------------------------------------------------
* LFN routines fixed to check for LFN support in OS's other than Windows 95,
  particularly Caldera OpenDOS with its LFN TSR loaded.  Thanks to Joseph
  Morris for bringing this problem to my attention.


Release 1.4 beta 2 -> Release 1.4 beta 3 (5.059), released 07/27/97
-------------------------------------------------------------------
* Bug with VESA mode detection and VESA VBE 2.0 compliant implementations
  (particularly the Matrox Millenium) fixed.  Thanks to Lost Dragon
  for helping me diagnose this one.


Release 1.4 beta 1 -> Release 1.4 beta 2 (5.056), released 07/17/97
-------------------------------------------------------------------
* ILBM files with masks load correctly.

* PCX pad byte handling fixed for 1, 2, and 4 bit-per-plane PCX pictures,
  meaning VP386 can read all 16-color PCXs it writes now.

* Right-click erasure with a brush no longer annoyingly replaces the old
  background underneath the final position of the brush.  This one bugged
  the (bleep) out of me while I was working on the AthenaPaint layout...


Release 1.3 -> Release 1.4 beta 1 (5.050), released 05/31/97
------------------------------------------------------------
* Outline shown in abstract filled polygon mode is now solid instead of
  speckled.

* Picture updated properly when objects are drawn in non-Normal blit mode
  in a virtual screen buffered video mode.

* Messageboxes no longer "lag" behind user input in virtual screen buffered
  modes.

* Same for the titlebar.

* 1x1x1 Dither now works properly with colors 0-7.

* Improved Mode X performance.  You wouldn't believe the 486s and Pentiums
  I've seen without VESA support!

* New "Detach All" option in Anim>Frame Palettes menu.

* Fine (2x2 matrix, 5 levels) and Coarse (4x4 matrix, 17 levels) ordered
  dithering has been added to 24-bit reduction, for better temporal
  compression in animations.

* Fixed a problem in the requester system causing animation colors
  to become scrambled after certain requesters closed.

* Fixed a dangling filehandle problem in loadlib.c causing file handle
  shortages when many extensions were loaded.

* Removed ugly kludge in ANIMIO.C that was causing page faults on AVI
  files with frames >64k.

* Crude Linux DOSEMU detection.

* Fixed a problem in the file requester that was causing catastrophic
  system failures in Windows 95 OSR2.


Release 1.2 -> Release 1.3 (4.953), released 03/21/97
-----------------------------------------------------
* Color cycling stops when requesters appear.

* Color cycler only writes colors to the VGA when necessary, greatly
  reducing "fuzz" on screen and increasing speed.

* Arrange requester now supports HSV adjustments in addition to RGB.

* Funny highlights in palette box fixed.

* VP386 can now detect if it is running Full Screen or Windowed under
  Windows 95, and will adjust its behavior accordingly.

* Right mouse button painting fixed, no longer acts same as left button
  with certain brush modes, such as replace/opaque.

* Serious bug in font rendering engine fixed which caused the file
  requester to appear very slowly in buffered video modes (Mode X, VESA
  without Linear Frame Buffer).  This also affected practically any
  text below the top fourth of the screen.

* AnimBrush support!  Doesn't paint or grab across frames, though.
  Use 7, 8, shift-7, shift-8, and shift-9 to handle them, and use the right
  mouse button with the brush tool to capture a frame instead of a new
  AnimBrush.

* Ability to save settings, for all you whiners who can't edit an INI file.

* Antialiased ellipses possible now, which means so are aspect-ratio correct
  circles.  Unfortunately, the ellipse algorithm is significantly slower than
  the circle one and is much less accurate with very squashed ellipses...

* [SL] About requester no longer crashes in hires LFB modes.

* [SL] Text works below line 200 in high resolution modes.

* [SL] Misplaced brush paste problem in highres modes fixed.

* [SL] Initial video mode and screen size now configurable.

* [SL] Picking up a brush flips you into Matte mode automatically.

* Antialiased filled circles and ellipses.

* Memory leak fixed in polygon routine, which has been rewritten.

* Shift-key x/y constriction added.

* -dvp command line option disables fast palette writes, an option previously
  only available with Wimp mode.  This solves problems with VGA systems such
  as PS/1 internal motherboard and Diamond Viper video cards producing
  invalid colors.

* -dvl flag disables VESA Linear Frame Buffer support.

* Rudimentary support for Windows 95 .ANI animated cursor file saving.

* New rapid 6x7x6 and 6x6x6 dithering modes, and the ability to control the
  maximum number of colors used for adaptive color reduction.

* Fixed a bug which caused submenus to be annoyingly placed one pixel out
  of reach when placed on the left.

* Shell-out icon works in hires modes.

* Assigns are resolved in assign paths, so assigns can reference other paths.

* Rudimentary support for uncompressed 16-bit and 24-bit AVI files, and
  16-bit Microsoft Video 1 files.

* Tile map painting!!!  16x16 tiles only, and very sketchy.  See help file.

* Variable zoom sizes from 1x1 to oo x oo (those are infinity signs).


Release 1.15 (Interim) -> Release 1.2 (4.660), released 01/01/97
----------------------------------------------------------------
* Align Frame Palettes option aligns frame palettes in an animation to
  reduce flicker, especially in color index 0.

* Easter egg shows up on a virtual buffered screen.  aargh...

* Standard listbox requester fixed up a little bit to look better in
  high resolution screens.

* The junky 12x16 font has been revised a bit.

* Polygon routine fixed so that it doesn't leave inverted dots on
  sides.

* Antialiased circles supported.  Unfortunately, ellipses, including
  circles in Aspect Ratio mode, are not yet antialiased.

* Plain circle routine revised to avoid "pointy" circles.

* Added .PPM to the autoloader list as an IFF extension.  I have no idea
  if the loader will load all PPM files but it seems to load at least a
  few of them.

* 24-bit color reduction routine revised to always use all 256 colors in
  the palette when all colors cannot be accurately represented.  Before,
  it sometimes only used from 248-254 when more would increase quality.

* Mouse pointers enlarged!!!  No more dinky pointers in 1024x768.

* Mouse routines fixed to prevent "sluggish" response when the mouse
  pointer is repeatedly shown and hidden.

* All instances of delay() have been ripped out of VP386, cutting the
  startup time for VP386 in half, or even more on really slow systems.

* [SL] Reboot problem when choosing the Abort option has been solved.
  Actually, it was caused by moving the mouse after the abort.  MODE
  CO80 at the DOS prompt unhooks the handlers and bypasses this problem
  as well.

* PCX writing speed increased by eliminating stupid status bar update.

* Multiple PCX save animation option.  Somewhat boneheaded in
  implementation.  You need to spell out the numbers (ANIM0000.PCX)
  for the first file.

* Solved problem with PCX animloads that caused 8-bit palettes to load
  incorrectly.

* [SL] The VP386 prompt now says "[VP386]" when you have shelled out.  No
  longer will you have 6 copies of VP386 running unless you want to.

* Running VP386 without a mouse driver no longer leaves crud on screen.

* Help requester fills screen vertically.  Whoopee.

* Drawing file displayed in titlebar.


Release 1.1 -> Release 1.15 (Interim 4.575), released 12/20/96
----------------------------------------------------------------------
* [SL] IFF picture loader no longer stomps on memory if the "Load and
  Clip" option is chosen.

* [SL] ESC and space now quit many requesters.

* Hires toolbar now has the outline and filled object tool icons in the
  correct order.

* Video Driver requester enlarged significantly.

* New "StartupOptions=" tag in VP386.INI allows command line options to
  be specified in VP386.INI.  For instance:

	StartOptions ="-w640 -h400"

  tells VP386 to start with a 640x400 bitmap.

* [DB] Critical error handler installed, so no more "Abort, Retry, Ignore,
  Fail?" messages on-screen.

* All benchmarking options are now by default Disabled.  An additional
  "Video driver write speed" option has been added, which measures video
  write speed with screen clears.

* Detected VESA modes now show the mode number used and whether a Linear
  Frame Buffer is used with the mode or not.

* [EQ] The PMODE/W version no longer fails the virus check.  AARGH.  This
  was caused by running PMWSETUP _after_ running VCorrect.


Release 1.0 -> Release 1.1 (4.543), released 12/12/96
-----------------------------------------------------
* Memory leak in PCX loader that occurred when PCX loads failed has been
  fixed.

* Planar PCX pictures that are taller than the current picture buffer
  should now load correctly.

* Improved frame palette support in animation.  Also fixed bug that caused
  animations with frame palettes to play incorrectly.

* Fixed "off-cursor" problem in requesters that use small text in high
  resolution modes that use large system fonts.

* Boolean/Trinary requesters no longer overlap buttons. (yuck)

* [SL] BMP loader routines now handle loading oversized/undersized pictures
  into a bitmap correctly.

* [SL] You can no longer delete frames to end up with (-2/-2) in the
  titlebar and a general mess on-screen.

* [SL] Clicking when the "VGAPaint" wireframe About anim is zooming to the
  upper left no longer quits and leaves you with the anim still on-screen.

* AutoLoader support added which automatically detects most supported
  filetypes.

* [SL] Magnify tool now centers correctly, and the "m" key now instant-
  zooms.  The "M" key brings up the zoom window.  < and > keys adjust zoom.

* Dither options work again.  Oops.

* [SL] Project>Info>Benchmark now displays a "Benchmarking..." message on-
  screen.

* [SL] Spacebar with the outline polygon tool auto-closes, while ESC leaves
  out the last line.  Also, tolerance for closing the last point now depends
  on display metrics.

* [SL] No more lingering DEF icon.

* The d, e, w, c, r, etc. keys don't leave icons lying around in full-screen
  mode anymore.

* [everyone] Fixed that blasted bug that caused the drawing coordinate to
  suddenly shift when the mouse was moved into/out of the zoom window in
  zoom mode, adding strange lines to the drawing.

* Bug fixed that would cause weird dragging behavior when the user held the
  mouse button on a slider zone have been squashed.

* [SL] Support for varying scroll rates and tablet scrolling have been
  added.

* [SL] Ctrl-C won't quit the program anymore.

* [SL] Tone and RGB Gamma controls are F8 and Shift-F8 now.  Sheesh,
  should've just called the program "DPaint 386"...

* [SL] Coordinates erase themselves when disabled.

* [SL] Drawing with a brush and the right-mouse-button now defaults to
  matte/replace behavior, like Dpaint.

* VESA 2.0 32-bit protected-mode bombing problem with mode search at startup
  has been solved.  IT WILL WORK THIS TIME. No idea why UniVBE doesn't like
  me asking for the protected mode interface in text mode.

* The foreground color highlight box in the palette now changes correctly.
  Stupid code...

* [SL] HELP SYSTEM!!!!!  It seems that not that many of you out there are
  programmers...

* New VP386 Athena and Apollo animation players replace the cruddy Anplay
  program.

* Problem with network paths (\\computer\directory) have been fixed.  VP386
  should now properly start from and load files over a network.

* Aspect ratios fixed for Mode X video driver; actual circles in 320x400!

* Info and Palette requesters don't leave mouse marks anymore when you exit.

* Info requester reports animations size.

* Eyedropper (comma key) works correctly now.

* Prefs menu reorganized -- no longer a hideous mess.

* The "No-flicker brush" can no longer be chosen in screen-buffered modes,
  where it is useless anyway, because brush flicker can't occur with a
  virtual screen buffer in use.

* [SL] High resolution tools, for high resolution modes.


Alpha 7 -> Release 1.0 (4.161), released 11/17/96
-------------------------------------------------
* Gradiated and brush map fill tools fixed; the screen is now properly
  updated when these tools are used in zoom or virtual-buffered screen
  modes.

* Zoom mode now acts normal, you don't need to scroll before use.

* Line drawing with brushes no longer results in funny drawings, since
  the line function doesn't flip lines to always go left-to-right and
  top-to-bottom.

* Idle support improved, VP386 now tries to run at full speed while the
  user is active.  If the user sits idle at the main paint screen for
  five seconds, VP386 enters into a "superidle" mode where VP386 sits in
  a tight loop calling the idle function, at which time CPU usage under
  Windows 95 drops to below 1% when other tasks are running.

* A really stupid bug fixed: Wimp mode no longer turns on when LFN's are
  disabled with the -dl switch.

* YES! I finally renamed the stupid .prj file to MAKEFILE like everyone
  else.

* Self-extracting PCX's!  No more writing stupid PCX decompression code
  when I don't feel like it.  (Modular code?  What's modular code? :-)

* Overwriting problem with the titlebar in top placement fixed.

* Advanced Capture now works correctly with 0k allocated to Static
  Capture Memory (which Adv. Capture does not use).  Additionally,
  Advanced Capture memory is no longer allocated when used with other
  capture modes.

* Rudimentary help balloon support added; now you can tell the color index
  and RGB value of a color instantly by hovering the mouse over it.  The
  option "SmoothBalloons = Yes" smooths out their motion.

* Debugging/not-ready options no longer show up in release version unless
  "Athena=True" appears in the INI file.

* The Mode X driver now uses consistent metrics.  It used to use varying
  metrics in different parts of the screen, corrupting many of the
  requesters and creating elements that didn't fit on screen when they
  should.

* Rudimentary support for a toolbar at the bottom of the screen that
  does not scroll while the rest of the screen does.  Hit Ctrl-F10 to try
  it; you probably want to hit Shift-F10 also.  Only works in a couple
  video modes (neither of which scroll).

* PCX Optimization command added (Special>Process>PCX Optimize) that
  rearranges the palette for better PCX compression.  It can gain anywhere
  from 0-50% in space savings, but typically it gets from 2-15%.  Colors 0
  and 255 are left alone.  Note that this is NOT the same as a histogram
  sort!

* Better aspect ratio support; if the screen scanline density is changed,
  circles will still look like circles.  You no longer have to turn off
  "aspect ratio" when you change to a 1:1 video mode.

* Got rid of that stupid TEMP.C file.

* Virus detection beefed up, now checks stub for infection.  Note that this
  means you can no longer run PMWSETUP to change the stub from the standard
  DOS/4GW stub to the PMODE/W stub without running VCORRECT.  Also note that
  virus checking in VP386 is still not robust enough to catch stealth
  viruses (those that intercept disk reads and hide the virus from the
  read image).

* 16-color dither option fixed.  Oh boy, another useless function works now.

* Video library modified to use palette shadowing; eliminates funny palette
  problems when gamma correction is active.

* Individual video drivers can now use different monitor gamma settings
  automatically.  For instance, the entry:

	[Mode 13h (320x200)]
	RedGamma   = 1.795
	GreenGamma = 2.327
	BlueGamma  = 2.134

  tells VP386 to use gamma settings of { 1.795, 2.327, 2.134 } when in the
  320x200 mode.

* Delta and "un-delta" options added, to help experimentation with
  compression algorithms.  (heh heh)  Photographic files can save/zip
  significantly better sometimes after a delta-horiz>delta-vert>pcx optimize
  process.

* Abstract color requester added, when you need that special color.  Who says
  fixed-point is dead on the Pentium? :)

* Special>Spare>Get Palette has been fixed; it now loads all 256 colors
  immediately.

* Menu options now flip to the left if there is not enough room on the right.

* Bringing up the save requester on a new picture no longer results in a
  cleared path field.

* The Airbrush now can be configured to use different shape brushes; right-
  click on the airbrush icon.  The size, however, is still fixed.

* Print requester fixed, the stupid INI file will now read correctly.  Also
  it no longer defaults to LPT1: since that doesn't work for some reason...

* AARGH.  The 12x16 system font and the two printer INI files are now
  included as the readme file says they should.

* Capture functions sped up slightly.  6-to-8-bit translation now uses bit
  shifts instead of integer multiply & divide (yuck).  By the way, has
  anyone noticed that the "blip line" that shows up when VP386 does an
  advanced capture also shows up when you hit PrtSc in a DOS Window with
  Windows 95?


Alpha 6 -> Alpha 7 (4.008), released 10/5/96
--------------------------------------------
* Font files restored.  Just my luck, while I was working on the LFN file
  open routines, I tried a version which opened read files for write...
  and I didn't realize what had happened...  If you found 0 byte .VFN files
  in the archive, this is why.

* File requester fixed; file/dir selection works correctly with large system
  fonts.

* A bug in the PCX8 writing routines has been fixed that caused both
  VP386 and Adobe Photoshop's loader routines to occasionally barf on pictures
  with odd picture widths (and I do mean odd, as in not even).  Apparently
  8-bit PCXs aren't supposed to be padded to an even number of image bytes...

* New easter egg and bug fixes in the old one.  The new one tells you
  if it worked... the old one is a little easier to activate... and
  has a new message.

  Just remember to save your work before attempting the old easter egg.
  And also remember it won't work unless you activate the new one, which
  you need to do from the command line.

  Trust me, you'll notice both of them.

* This file reversed.  Whoopee.

* Loading black&white PCX files no longer result in black pictures.  This
  is only a palette handling change; the picture was always loaded correctly,
  but you used to have to adjust color 1 manually.

* Some programs save weird BMP 8-bit BMP files that claim to use 257 colors.
  Problems with memory corruption due to this have been fixed.

* Arrange requester upgraded to have rudimentary RGB adjustments.

* VESA 2.0 modes now supported, and VP386 now queries the VESA BIOS for the
  mode list, so no more 1280x1024 modes on cards that only support 800x600.

* Video mode requester enlarged to 8 lines for ease of use.

* VESA information structure memory increased to 276 bytes to accomodate
  bad VESA bioses which write 268 bytes instead of the proper 256, at least
  according to Rolf Brown's Interrupt List.  No idea if it fixes anything.

* Mouse system revamped to fix bugs in VESA routines caused by lack of
  stack switching.  This change also made any previous drivers invalid.

* S3 Trio64 linear driver fixed, no longer uses 6x8 font on such a large
  screen!

* Toolbars enlarged!  Lots bigger now in some video modes.  Some funny
  artifacts, though.  Not to mention some odd aspect ratios...

* PCX loading fixed... again.  BW and Color pictures should now be
  identified correctly.

* Arrange requester has new options: SwapPic, Undelete, and Unused.  SwapPic
  swaps colors on the picture as well to keep the picture consistent;
  Undelete brings colors back from the dead; Unused deletes colors that are
  not used on the picture.

* Binary requester uses system fonts now.  One less requester that uses
  itty-bitty fonts on a 1024x768 screen.

* 12x16 font created.  Looks a little weird, but it's bigger.

* Graphing calculator and cycles game fixed; new font editor extension.

* Serious bug in animation decompressor fixed that would sometimes cause
  page faults when used with tall pictures (>=256 pixels).

* "f" now activates fill.  Oops.

* Display corruption problem with screen&bitmap size requester fixed.


Alpha 5 -> Alpha 6 (3.870), released 9/18/96
--------------------------------------------
* Definition of _choice in extdata.h changed.

* Definition of _picbm in extdata.h changed from (struct Bitmap *) to
  (struct BitMap **).

* Switched to version 2 of the GNU GPL, which specifically forbids software
  patents.  Note that this change actually occurred in Alpha 5 but I forgot
  about it...

* Bug fixed in menu.c that could cause menu items to not toggle when
  selected.

* REQ_SLDREPHIT flag added for requesters allowing sliders to continuously
  scroll when the button is held down.

* Small fix in VESA routines: BitsPerPixel field omitted out of VESA
  structure.  This shouldn't have caused any problems.

* BIG FIX in VESA routines: VESA routines accidentally reversed A and B
  window addresses.  The Diamond Stealth 64 BIOS reports a valid B window
  address, which is why I didn't originally find it.  UniVBE (SciTech Display
  Doctor) supplies a window B address of 0000 if Window B does not exist.
  This bug caused VP386 to trash memory from 0000:0000 to 0000:ffff,
  which pretty well screwed up all the interrupt vectors and rebooted
  the system.  If VESA modes used to reboot your machine, this is why.

* Yet another change to VESA routines.  VESA VBE 2.0 32-bit protected mode
  mode switch routines and linear frame buffers are now supported.

* Assign (AmigaDOS-style) system added!  No more looking through huge blasted
  lists of directories and single drive letters to find your pictures!  Read
  the README file for information.

* Windows 95 Long File Name (LFN) support!  Now you can use long file names
  in VP386!  Now can any of the OS/2 gurus out there tell me how I can
  implement LFN support for OS/2 also?


Alpha 4 -> Alpha 5 (3.811)
--------------------------

* Finally! Overwrite confirmation when saving files.  No more overwriting
  precious files.

* The read_timer() function has been fixed and now latches the timer,
  possibly eliminating occasional jolts (<1/18th sec) in playback time.

* Tiny ANPLAY.COM utility added to play back .VAN animations.

* A little algebra used to noticeably speed up gamma curve generation for
  the Monitor Adjust requester on systems without math coprocessors.

* Transparency/Add mode has been fixed, the titlebar and tools bar are no
  longer overwritten when the drawn area is clipped by one of those
  boundaries.  Thanks to David Beswick for finding this one.

* Very stupid bug fixed in io.c.  The DPMI_Yield() call now calls Int 2F
  Function 1680h instead of Int 31 Function 1680h to yield CPU time.  The
  KernelToy WinTop now shows 0.10% CPU use when VP386 is not the foreground
  task.  Note that under Windows 95, when VP386 is the foreground task,
  it will still hog CPU time.

* fpcol, sysfontwidth, and sysfontheight variables added to extension stub.

* The standard color picker has been rewritten.  It is now much more tolerant
  than the original routine.  You may end up with purple toolboxes, though.
  However, the routine does take saturation into account, so if you have a
  good palette you will still obtain good 3D toolboxes.

* The file requester now has normal background fields when the standard color
  system is set to flip colors.  Another kludge caused it.

* File requester routines have been changed to recall a picture's old
  filename and path when requested to load or save.


Alpha 3 -> Alpha 4 (3.785)
--------------------------
* The palette_pickHighColor() function has been fixed; curly bracket keys and
  clicking right mouse button on a pick (, key) now updates color on screen.

* A new INI file option has been added: under the [Options] group, add
  "InitialModeRequester = on" to tell VP386 to bring up the mode requester
  immediately after startup.

* A new capture mode has been added: RapidFire.  This is a simple capture
  mode that has been improved in two ways: 1) once triggered it takes shots
  as often as it can, and 2) it tries not to grab the same frame multiple
  times.

* Preliminary Anim Load/Saves have been added, although they are in a
  proprietary format (a series of IFF compressed key frames).  Since
  the compression is spatially based and not temporally based, digitized
  animations compress like crap.

* README.DP file created for those who use DPaint (everyone).

* New INI entry "RequesterImageDrag = on" causes requesters to image-drag
  instead of outline drag.

* Function mouse_read3() removed from mouse.c due to worthlessness.

* Memory swapping performance (the qswapl() function) has been improved
  slightly.

* Program copyright string has been clarified.  (whoopee)

* Possible bug in the PMODE/W compressed version in Alpha 3 has been fixed.
  If I ever found out what caused it I'll let you know. :-)

* Multiple (>2) pictures in memory implemented.

* New capture mode added: RapidFire/Compressed.  Much slower than RF mode
  (can anyone write a *really* fast IFF compressor?) but allows up to 4x
  the frames to be captured at times.

* Spare Underlay/Overlay/Add now works with picture sizes other than 320x200.

* The ModeX driver has been revamped to allow overscan displays such as
  392x508 to be displayed on standard VGA equipment.  Slightly higher
  resolutions such as 400x508 are possible but require the horizontal retrace
  period to be shrunk, making them less reliable.

* Two new buttons have been added to the screen size requester: Video and Max.
  Currently they are only useful for the ModeX drivers.  Video requests the
  largest display available without serious tweaking of registers, and Max
  requests much more tweaking to obtain the maximum display.

* Edit fields no longer leave stray cursors when mouse clicks are used to
  exit them.

* Menu keyboard shortcut text is now dimmed along with the main text in
  disabled items.


Alpha 2 -> Alpha 3 (3.677)
--------------------------
* The ActivateField() function now hides the cursor before drawing the cursor;
  cursors are now shown normally in fields.

* Toggle zones with right-click special actions now restore the toggle state
  on screen after the button has been right-clicked.

* HideRequester() and ShowRequester() functions added.

* New NumInfoField() function places a numeric value into a numeric field.

* pick_point() function allows picking of points "under" a requester.

* Grid requester now has a "pick point" button.

* A clipping error in vid13_tile() that might crash the computer has been
  corrected.

* An obscure bug in change_paint_tool() has been fixed - stupid kludge
  from months past caused it, bombing special zone hit handlers for the
  tools.  This bug fix also corrects the problem of the machine rebooting
  after the user selects a zooming rectangle, without tools, with the 'm'
  button.

* The kbd_check() function has been rewritten to avoid freezing some systems
  (waiting until another keypress) when Ctrl-Alt-Keypad+ and Ctrl-Alt-Keypad-
  are pressed to change system speed.

* The ` key, which was a test key for octree lookup, has been disabled.
  It's too annoying even on my Pentium.

* Palette color selection has been fixed; the mouse pointer no longer moves
  sporadically when one tries to "drag" across the palette.

* Palette picking (comma key) now switches palette pages at the appropriate
  time, instead of the exact opposite.  This change also affects how often
  the bracket keys ([ and ]) change the palette page.

Alpha 1 -> Alpha 2 (3.635)
--------------------------
* Fixed the really lame bug that was causing VP386 to page fault whenever
  an advanced capture was done and one typed EXIT to return to VP386.

* Stopped the VPSTAT command from saying "*unable to allocate*" for static
  memory when none was allocated.

* Fixed obscure bug in the rhline/rhlineread functions of the Mode X
  driver that caused the driver to overwrite successive lines.  Also
  fixed bug that occurred when ModeX driver was called on to render/
  read a single line not on a longword screen boundary.  Generally
  fixed lots of bugs in the driver!

* Multiple point polygon engine fixed to fix outline bug.

* Various cosmetic changes.

* Zone inversion routine fixed; buttons no longer white-out.

* Documentation improved. (slightly)

* LIBSTART.OBJ has actually been _included_ in the source zip file this
  time.

* Deadweight files have been cleaned out.
