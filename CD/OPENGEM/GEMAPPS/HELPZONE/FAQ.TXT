What is OpenGEM?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

OpenGEM is a graphical user interface for DOS.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------
What is OpenGEM for?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

OpenGEM is a visual way to work with files.  It's a simple 16bit graphical 
user interface designed to be easy to install and use.  It's intended 
to make computers running DOS more user friendly.  It also features 
powerful file manipulation tools like drag and drop.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Which version of OpenGEM should I choose?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

There are two types of OpenGEM. 

OpenGEM is a small but powerful file manager with full support for DR GEM
and FreeGEM applications.

OpenGEM/XM is a multi-tasking version of OpenGEM.

You can download these from from <http://gem.opendawn.com/>


---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Can I upgrade from an old version of OpenGEM?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Yes, if you download a new version of OpenGEM just run the installation
program, and when prompted tell it to overwrite all existing files.

If you have OpenGEM Release 4 Update 1 or above you don't need to 
download a complete OpenGEM distribution to update the system.
Simply download an update package from the Shane Land OpenGEM site.

You can download a new version of OpenGEM, or an update package, from 
<http://gem.opendawn.com/>.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Does OpenGEM have skins?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

No, OpenGEM does not have skins.  Nor will it have skins.  It is intended
to be easy to use, not to provide eye candy.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Will OpenGEM become 32bit/64bit/etc etc etc?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

No.  OpenGEM is intended to be a simple and small graphical user interface
for the DOS operating system.  Our target is to support FreeDOS effectively
and to empower DOS users with the advantages (drag and drop, simple
multiple file actions) of GUIs without getting stuck with the disadvantages
(extensive memory use, confusing bloat).


---------------------------------------------------------------------------
How can I help develop OpenGEM?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

There is an OpenGEM SDK with all the GEM binaries, source code and 
things like bindings.  You can download that from the Shane Land
OpenGEM website <http://gem.opendawn.com/> and make something.

Alternatively, you can review the existing OpenGEM distributions and
make comments or suggested changes, and email them to the OpenGEM
support email address <info@opendawn.com>

You could also just download the OpenGEM SDK, and go make your own
GEM distribution.  Sharing is caring, and bringing an old computer
back to life for a kid who wants to fiddle with it is a great thing.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Where can I find GEM-based alternatives to OpenGEM?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

There are alternatives to OpenGEM.  Owen Rudge's FreeGEM distribution 
is one such alternative, and you can download it for free from his
website <http://www.owenrudge.net/GEM/>.  You can also try other graphical
user interfaces for DOS.  If you go to the FreeDOS website you can
find some links <http://www.freedos.org/>.
