*** Intro ***

uHex is a simple and fast hex editor primarily written for DOS, but available
for other systems, too. It has been written with care to work fast even on an
8086 CPU, providing support for large files (up to 2 GiB) while using minimal
amounts of memory. "uHex" stands for "micro Hex".
uHex supports several video text modes (80x25, 80x43, 80x50.. and any other,
as long as it has at least 80 columns), both in color and black & white modes.

*** Hardware requirements (DOS version) ***

uHex has very low requirements. It runs on anything that provides:
 - an 8086/8088 compatible CPU,
 - a MS-DOS 2.0 compatible operating system,
 - ca. 20K of free conventional memory,
 - an 80 columns video mode.


*** How to use ***

Run uHex using at least the file you'd like to open as a parameter (possibly
with additional parameters).

Usage: uhex file [/mono | /color] [/ro]

 /mono   forces monochrome display mode
 /color  forces color display mode
 /ro     opens the file in read-only mode

Once uHex is launched, the following key bindings are available:

ALT+H - Help (F1 works too)
ALT+J - Jump to offset
ALT+F - Find an ASCII or HEX string occurence
ALT+S - Save file, applying all modifications
ALT+U - Undo all modifications (reverts the file from disk)
ESC   - Quit uHex


*** How to build ***

I built uHex using the Borland Turbo C 2.01 compiler, altough any C89 compiler
should be okay, as long as it provides int86() facilities.

Since v1.0.2, uHex can also be compiled for platforms other than DOS, using
gcc and the curses-based I/O driver.
Since v1.0.3 compilation for Windows NT using the WinAPI-based I/O driver is
supported.
