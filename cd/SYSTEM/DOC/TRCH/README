This is the readme for the FreeDOS TRCH program

TRCH converts characters from one to another.  This is really useful
if you need to convert a text file between UNIX (end of line is "^J")
and DOS (end of line is "^M^J" or "\n").

This program has international support using the "Cats" library
(catopen/catgets implementation for DOS).  You can download "Cats"
from http://www.freedos.org/jhall/cats

TRCH is distributed under the GNU GPL.  See the file COPYING for
details.  Cats is distributed under the GNU LGPL.
